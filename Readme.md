Create 20 different jQuery interactions. This will included creating numerous elements in your HTML some will have an event attached while others will be there for you to do something to when an event happens.

I would like to see the following used at least once.
.on('click')
keypress, keydown or keyup - at least pick one
.hover() - remember this one includes both the mouseenter and mouseleave)
.one() - note this is different than .on

The actions you take after an event happens can be anything. Be creative! You CAN use jQuery animations like .fadeIn, .slideUp etc BUT you must also create another one that does the same thing with CSS animations. This is to see how both sides work.

I should see a LOT more CSS animations/transitions than ones done purely with jQuery though. 

Bonus Points for anyone who can create an input field as as I type it have the text displayed below it (as well as in it)!

Make sure you create a new Yeoman project for this and make sure you have a gh-pages branch properly created. See me if you are still struggling with this. I should be able to open this up and play around with out any JS errors!

Last thought. Do NOT overthink this. Have fun, use images etc but don't let this fry your brain. This is meant to teach you a little more of how manipulating the DOM works and how jQuery grabs an element and does something to it.

This is due tomorrow morning.
